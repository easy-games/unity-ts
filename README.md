<div align="center">The TypeScript Compiler for Airship</div>

# Introduction
**unity-ts** is the compiler for Airship's _Typescript_ scripting. It is a different flavour of TypeScript that [compiles to Luau](https://docs.airship.gg/typescript/js-to-luau).

## Getting started with Airship

# Documentation
Below is our documentation around quirks and features of this Typescript compiler
- [AirshipBehaviour](https://docs.airship.gg/typescript/airshipbehaviour) - Airship's TypeScript parallel to `MonoBehaviour`
- [DataType math](https://docs.airship.gg/typescript/datatype-math) - Since Typescript has no operators, we have our own operator "macros"
- [JS to Luau](https://docs.airship.gg/typescript/js-to-luau) - Our flavour of TypeScript is a Luau-based one, so our API is a little different from vanilla TypeScript.

# Special Thanks
We give our apprecation to the [roblox-ts](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts) project on which unity-ts is based.
